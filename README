Cobcy is a free cobol compiler. It compiles cobol code into
frequently messy, but readable C (confusion is mostly due to long 
variable names). Turning wrapping off while viewing helps a lot.
Current capabilities include a lot of basic COBOL, but several features,
like arrays, strings, and record-record MOVEs are still missing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was a project of mine back in 1996, which is when the last release
occured. I dug this up recently on uu.net, and decided to put it up to
some public place. It might make a decent starting point if you want to
make a COBOL compiler.

I do not want to maintain it; I just cleaned it up a bit to get it to
compile with current gcc and uSTL releases. So tell me if it crashes,
but forget about new features.

The "alberto" branch is for Alberto Santini's changes. He did some work
on the project between 1996 and 1999, and made two releases. I ought to
merge some of that in, when I figure out exactly what he did.

=========================================================================

QuickStart:
-----------
you need gcc 4.7 for c++14 support
    (for cobcy itself, the COBOL is compiled to c99)

download and install uSTL library from https://github.com/msharov/ustl

./configure && make
compile things using 'cobcy -o program.c program.cob'

There are some tests available in the 'bvt' directory, which can be
run automatically with 'make check'. See documentation in the docs
directory for more information about the program. If you have a problem,
run cobcy with -g flag and send me the output of thus generated program,
the generated C code, and the test file you used.
