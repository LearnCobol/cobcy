Cobcy is a free cobol compiler. It compiles cobol code into
frequently messy, but readable C (confusion is mostly due to long 
variable names). Turning wrapping off while viewing helps a lot.
Current capabilities include a lot of basic COBOL, but several features,
like arrays, strings, and record-record MOVEs are still missing.

This was a project of mine back in 1996, which is when the last release
occured. I dug this up recently on uu.net, and decided to put it up to
some public place. It might make a decent starting point if you want to
make a COBOL compiler. I don't know yet if I want to maintain it much. I
plan to clean it up a bit and maybe make one release that compiles on
a modern gcc.

The "alberto" branch is for Alberto Santini's changes. He did some work
on the project between 1996 and 1999, and made two releases. I ought to
merge some of that in, when I figure out exactly what he did.

cleantest, cobol, and most the other scripts are for BASH. 
They assume that /bin/sh is BASH-compatible. If that's not right - edit.
If you use CC, the dependencies cannot be automatically created.
Try using Makefile.CC

	QuickStart:
	-----------
	* run the configure script
	* run make depend
	* run make
	* compile things using 'cobol program.cob'

There are some tests available in the 'tests' directory, the working 
ones are listed in WORKING_TESTS file in this directory.
You can run numbered tests [1-x] by typing 'run [1-x]'. For others,
type in the full name. See the 'run' script for more info.

Yes, there are some more docs available (Yippee!!), although still
not very abundant; mostly code overview for hackers. Users may want
to read the syntax guide and stop there.

If you add code, I would appreciate it if you read CODE.STY file.

If you have a problem, run cobcy with -g flag and no NDEBUG macro 
(defined in the Makefile) and send me the output of
thus generated program, the generated C code (.c and .h), and the
test file you used. Feel free to find bugs on your own though :)
