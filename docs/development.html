<H2>Features to implement</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Better index file building (B-tree balancing specifically)
<LI> Arrays.
<LI> Strings.
<LI> Exception handling.
<LI> At least a minimum manual, that is better than this page.
<LI> Make this page actually say which features are supported.
	(Now it does a very poor job at it)
<LI> And a lot more stuff :)
</UL>

<H2>How can I help?</H2>

<OL>
<LI> Well, try to compile and run it. If you have problems, tell me about it.
<LI> Read through the code and tell me which parts are confusing to read.
	I'll try to either restructure the bad part or to put some comments 
	there.  Of course, if you don't know C++ very well it will all look 
	confusing :) Do this if you can read C++ code.
<LI> Help implementing a feature that you know
	about - just tell me what you are working on to avoid overlap.
<LI> Look at the above listed "wish list". See if you can do any of that.
	Again, tell me first that you'll be doing it.
</OL>
Reading through someone's code is not easy, but it can be done. In
fact some people have already contributed (well, just one so far):
<UL>
<LI>Hans Deleu (Hans.Deleu@ping.be)
	wrote QUOTES code, some conditionals, and added support 
	for '\B0' in pictures.
</UL>
