Introduction
------------

Welcome to CobCy 0.4, a cobol compiler for creating 32-bit programs for
OS/2 2.x, OS/2 3.x, and DOS. You can use the GNU C++ compiler to
compile programs for CobCy. The main design goal of CobCy is to have
a FREE, portable cobol compiler.

It compiles cobol code into frequently messy C.
The code is very alpha, which means that it might not compile and run.
Current capabilities include a lot of basic COBOL, but several key
features, like indexed files, are still missing.
