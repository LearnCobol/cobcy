Just a few comments and observations about v0.4.

The only bug I found is this one.
- This will stop cobcy with no messages and a return code of 139.
  01  WTABLE.
    05  FILLER      PIC X(1250).

These are parse statement errors I came across. You probably know about
then anyway.
- Types COMP COMP-3 will not parse.
- Arrays seam to work only if INDEXED BY is used. For example this will not
parse;
  01  MONTH-AND-YEAR-TODATE-ACCS.                                  
    05  BREAK-ACCS          OCCURS   5.               
      10  UNITS-ACCS        OCCURS  30.              
         15  CURR-MONTH-ACC     PIC 9(12).
         15  CURR-YTD-ACC       PIC 9(12).
- Value all will not parse. For example; 
  01  FILLER                      PIC X(20) VALUE ALL 'X'.
- Redefines with pic will not parse. For example; 
  10  LINE-UNIT   PIC ZZZZZZZ.
  10  LINE-DIF REDEFINES LINE-UNIT   PIC -ZZZ.ZZ.
- Levels 88 with multi value will not parse. For example;
  01  S-DATE.
    05  R-MTH                 PIC X(03).
      88  VALID-MONTH         VALUE  'JAN' 'FEB' 'MAR'.
- Negation logic will not parse. For example this will not work
   IF NOT DIST-ZONE-NAT AND
      NOT REGION AND
      NOT TERR
  however this will work
    IF DIST-ZONE-NAT AND
       REGION AND
       TERR
