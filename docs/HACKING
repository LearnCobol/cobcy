This file is intended to have some general guidelines for adding code:

	* In the grammar, the difference between statement and a clause
		is that clauses should be unambiguous if stringed together
		with no periods between.

	* Use the functions prototyped in semutil.h as often as possible

	* Adding a new semantic action to a sem* file requires addition of
		a prototype in the corresponding .h file, not in
		semactions.h!

	* Write a comment here and there ;)

	* Before adding a rule to the grammar, think if it is ambiguous
		I don't care if it is in the ANSI standard. If it is hard
		to parse, like the IF .. ELSE IF .. complex, try to simplify
		it. For example denying the existance of the ELSE IF clause
		simplifies the grammar, but gives the same result (try it)
