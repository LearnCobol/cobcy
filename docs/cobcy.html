<h1>Cobol to C GPL compiler</h1>
<hr />

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>
<tt>Cobcy</tt> is a free COBOL compiler distributed under MIT license. 
Cobcy is intended to compile ANSI COBOL sources. The current version does
not yet support everything (in fact, some people use the word "puny" when
describing the feature set), but enough for a beginner's program.
The funny name comes from COB[ol]-C and a 'y' to indicate how to
pronounce 'c'.
</p><p>
I am writing it for experience in compiler building and because reason was
that no free COBOL compilers are available anywhere on the net. In fact,
the only publicly available compiler, which is distributed as shareware,
<tt>cobol650</tt>, is very nagging and difficult to set up (I gave up
on it). <tt>cobol650</tt>'s only value to me were the example programs,
which I use to tests my compiler. I found them to contain a few bugs,
by the way.
