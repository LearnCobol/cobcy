If you want to add code, it would be easier for me to read if you use the
style already there (or at least make it look approximately like it):
The rules are flexible; just make sure it looks readable.

	* Statements are indented 4 spaces each level.
		This is the most important one for me. I chose 4 spaces
		because 3 is a little too short and 5 is a bit too long :)
		A good reason is that two such indents make a tab,
		a very convenient property. Using just tabs for indenting
		takes me off the screen way too quickly. So there you are.
	* Some original code still uses weird non-4 indents. If you change
		these areas, reformat the entire function with indent 4.
	* Tab size is 8.
	* Use tabs whenever possible.
	* Try to separate elements for readability. One space is usually
		enough. One possible exception is the empty function call.
		So here are some examples of good statements:
		    func();, func (a, b);, func (func (1, 5, func()));
		And BAD:
		    func   ()->&tur.nuik[12*67-!hj+123/7%hs->r]
		Get the picture? :)
	* The braces are K&R style
		if (x == 0) {
		}
	* Functions are named in the uppercase convention: ReadBigVar
		internal variables in generated C code are
		with prepended underscore: _ReadIntegerVar
	* Use hungarian notation, but don't go overboard.
	* If you write a skeleton code generation function that does 
		not do anything, include a call to NIY (defined in semutil.h)
	* Read the docs in ./docs
